      Perhaps you would like to be doing something with friends?
      Small groups of 2-4 can be arranged and itâ€™s a great way to
      get benefits of a private session without the hussle of busy
      studios and big groups.

    <p class="call-to-action">
      Please, feel free to write me an e-mail and we'll
      schedule a session for you and your friends.
