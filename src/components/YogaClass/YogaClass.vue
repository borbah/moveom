        It is a way of realizing and staying connected with ones own body
        giving it attention, allowing it to express itself fully, to test
        its boundaries, to realize its limitations, to let it breathe, to
        move and be present in this experience.

        While riding on your breath through the asana sequence you will
        find yourself going deeper through the layers of your body and mind,
        gaining awareness and freedom of expression on and off the mat.
