          For beginners it’s a great way to begin your yoga journey, having time to ask
          questions and integrate your knowledge into practice immediately. Establishing
          the correct alignment from the start is a massive advantage and it will pay
          off sooner than expected.

          For those working with injuries or wanting to strengthen a specific area of
          the body, one-to-one can be of much benefit – the sequences can be designed
          to work for your particular body, at the level of joints and groups of muscle
          as well as certain emotional or stress related tensions.
