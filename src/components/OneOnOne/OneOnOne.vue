          For beginners it’s a great way to begin your yoga journey, having time to ask
          questions and integrate your knowledge into practice immediately. Establishing
          the correct alignment from the start is a massive advantage and it will pay
          off sooner than expected.

          For those working with injuries or wanting to strengthen a specific area of
          the body, one-to-one can be of much benefit – the sequences can be designed
          to work for your particular body, at the level of joints and groups of muscle
          as well as certain emotional or stress related tensions.

          Working with stress related tensions and emotional overload can be deeply transformative.
          Having someone holding you with compassionate presence while you allow your system to
          unfold, can be a wonderful opportunity to let things out, let them go and to make room
          for a new settings. Anna works closely with Cranio-Sacral Therapist, who can assist you
          in this process on many levels. Double sessions of Yoga and Cranio-Sacral
          therapy can be arranged.
